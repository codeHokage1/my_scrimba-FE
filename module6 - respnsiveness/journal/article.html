					<p>
						After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
						Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code
						reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

					<h3 class="main-article-sub">How I stay committed to learning</h3>
					<p>
						I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
						and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
						learned or work new techniques into existing projects. While that was
						fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and
						most things about my journey with the world.
					</p>
					<h3 class="main-article-sub">How I got started</h3>
					<p>
						I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
						take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
						use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
						short summaries of what I learned using my own words. That helped me
						grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning
						summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
